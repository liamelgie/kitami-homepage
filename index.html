      <h2>What's new?</h2>
      <h3>Cloud Storage</h3>
      <p>
        åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â² (kitami two) has been reworked to utilise <a href='https://gsuite.google.co.uk/pricing.html'>GSuite's business plan's</a> unlimited cloud storage for hosting its media.
        This means the previous 4TB limit is long gone and all its restrictions have gone with it. <br /><br />While we're limited to adding <i>only</i> &nbsp;750GB a day, it allows us to continue to grow our libraries without sacraficing other content such as less popular or old films. It also means that the previous ban on TV shows is lifted and you can now request as many shows and as many seasons as you'd like!
        </p>
      <h3>10 Gbit Network</h3>
      <p>
        Previously, åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚ (kitami) was hosted on a 100mb/s connection which limited downloads and streaming to users (you) to less than 10MB/s. A 3GB file takes about 5 minutes to download and would take even longer if somebody was watching something at the same time. åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â² (kitami two) uses a 10gb/s connection which downloads that same 3GB file in <b>under 20 seconds</b>.<br /><br />
        This is huge when attempting to download every season of a show or when downloading films while simultaneously streaming content to multiple users. Because of this upgrade, the baseline quality for content has been upped to 1080p and will even allow for 4k streaming in the near future.
        </p>
      <h3>Scalability</h3>
      <p>
        Now that all of our content is hosted on Google's servers, there's no longer a need to rent a server with a RAID0 HDD setup. This has allowed us to use a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server'>VPS</a> instead which can be upgraded/downgraded as necessary. This lets me keep costs down when things are slow and upgrade performance when in need of a boost. <br /><br />
        Obviously, I'd prefer to keep costs down so I'll monitor usage and determine which level of performance is best for us. Your feedback is very important for this so please let me know if you have any issues with buffering or the like!
        </p>
      <h3>Docker</h3>
      <p>
        The transition to Docker containers for the 15 various programs that are used to keep things running allows me to much more easily keep an eye out for problems. While mainly for my benefit, it also lets me update, restart and fix programs without having to take the whole server down.
        </p>
      <h3>Ombi</h3>
      <p>
        åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â² (kitami two) uses Ombi to manage user requests for content. Before, I had to manually approve each request or deny it if it broke any rules. Now that the rules are out the window, I've enabled automatic request approval so the only delay will be in the time it takes to download it to the sever (typically seconds)!<br /><br />
        I've not tested this feature very extensively so please give it a go and see if it works. You can access Ombi <a href='https://ombi.kitami.cloud/search'>here</a>. Try logging in with Plex and if that doesn't work, select 'Sign In With åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â² - Ombi'. I import all the Plex accounts that are connected to the server so your login details will be the same. <br /><br />If you add something and it doesn't seem to be working, let me know and I'll determine the reason.
        </p>
      <h2>So what's with the sequel (Â²)?</h2>
      <p>
        It might seem strange to have a version-like increment to the name but I promise it's more than just a stylistic choice ðŸ˜‰ Because <span style='white-space: nowrap'>åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚</span>(kitami) is on a contract, it will still be available until it ends on the 21st of April. After that date, the server will go offline and will disappear from your Plex. I'm pretty sure that I've got everything covered as far as transitioning goes but if there's content missing, just let me know or request it via Ombi and it'll be back in no time!<br /><br />
        åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â² (kitami two) was named as such to allow Plex to differentiate it from the original so you can switch to it before it goes offline. To switch to the new server, just select 'åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â²' from your sources list and you'll be good to go! If you have any trouble with this, the 'Switch to a Different Source' section on <a href='https://support.plex.tv/articles/navigating-the-mobile-apps/'>this page</a> may help you.

      <h2>Things to note</h2>
      <h3>Transcoding</h3>
      <p>
        Transcoding (converting one file format to another) uses A LOT of processing power and is a nightmare when streaming content to a lot of users at once.
        However, by streaming at the highest quality possible (referred to as 'Original Quality' in Plex), the server can handle many streams without issue.<br /><br />
        The Plex web app is limited by the file formats supported by the browser it's running in. Where possible, I use HEVC/x265 due to its many benefits but browsers currently lack support for this standard.
        For best results, use the <a href='https://www.plex.tv/en-gb/apps-devices/#modal-devices-plex-media-player'>Plex Media Player app</a> when streaming content on your PC. <br /><br />
        On smartphones/tablets or TVs, just use the native app for that device and make sure that it's streaming at 'Original Quality'.
        If you're using iOS or tvOS, I <b>highly</b> recommend <a href='https://firecore.com/infuse'>Infuse</a> as it can directly play content extremely quickly and looks beautiful doing it.
      </p>
      <h3>Account Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        If anyone you know wants to use åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â² (kitami two), please avoid sharing your account as it can affect things behind-the-scenes. Each user is limited to a <u>single stream</u> in order to help manage traffic and will prevent you from watching anything if someone else is already using your account.<br><br>
        I am MORE than happy to invite friends and family to the server and will never turn people down! Please convince anyone you share your account with to make their own account and either send me a message or tell them to follow the steps on this page.
      </p>
      <h3>Donations</h3>
      <p>
        Donations are <b>COMPLETELY</b> optional but greatly appreciated! I am more than happy to cover the server costs myself but any help goes a long way ðŸ’° <br /><br /> With donations, I can bump up the servers hardware to improve performance (handy for the transcoding mentioned above) and buy access to more private indexers/trackers (making it easier to find the content you want). If you'd like to help out, you can do so <a href='https://paypal.me/liamelgie'>here</a>!
