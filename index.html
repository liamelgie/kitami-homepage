      <h2>What's new?</h2>
      <h3>Cloud Storage</h3>
      <p>
        åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â² (kitami two) has been reworked to utilise <a href='https://gsuite.google.co.uk/pricing.html'>GSuite's business plan's</a> unlimited cloud storage for hosting its media.
        This means the previous 4TB limit is long gone and all its restrictions have gone with it. While we're limited to adding <i>only</i> 750GB a day, it allows us to continue to grow our libraries without sacraficing other content such as less popular or old films. It also means that the previous ban on TV shows is lifted and you can now request as many shows and as many seasons as you'd like!
        </p>
      <h3>10 Gbit Network</h3>
      <p>
        Previously, åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚ (kitami) was hosted on a 100mb/s connection which limited downloads and streaming to users (you) to less than 10MB/s. A 3GB file takes about 5 minutes to download and would take even longer if somebody was watching something at the same time. åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â² (kitami two) uses a 10gb/s connection downloads that same 3GB file in <b>under 20 seconds</b>.<br />
        This is huge when attempting to download every season of a show or when downloading films while simultaneously streaming content to multiple users. Because of this upgrade, the baseline quality for content has been upped to 1080p and will even allow for 4k streaming in the near future.
        </p>
      <h3>Scalability</h3>
      <p>
        Now that all of our content is hosted on Google's servers, there's no longer a need to rent a server with a RAID0 HDD setup. This has allowed us to use a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server'>VPS</a> instead which can be upgrade/downgraded as necessary. This lets me keep costs down when things are slow and upgrade performance when in need of a boost. Obviously, I'd prefer to keep costs down so I'll monitor usage and determine which level of performance is best for us. Your feedback is very important for this so please let me know if you have any issues with buffering or the like!
        </p>
      <h3>Docker</h3>
      <p>
        The transition to Docker containers for the 15 various programs that are used to keep things running allows me to much more easily keep an eye out for problems and fix them without throwing my computer at the wall. This is mainly just for my benefit but it also lets me update, restart and fix programs without having to take the whole server down, which is good for everyone!
        </p>
      <h2>So what's with the sequel (Â²)?</h2>
      <p>
        It might seem strange to have a version-like increment to the name but I promise it's more than just a stylistic choice ðŸ˜‰. Because åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚ (kitami) is on a contract, it will still be available until it ends on the 20th of April. After that date, the server will go offline and will disappear from your Plex. I'm pretty sure that I've got everything covered as far as transitioning goes but if there's content missing, just let me know or request it via Ombi and it'll be back in no time!<br />
        åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â² (kitami two) was named as such to allow Plex to differentiate it from the original so you can switch to it before it goes offline. To switch to the new server, just select 'åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â²' from your sources list and you'll be good to go! If you have any trouble with this, the 'Switch to a Different Source' seciton on <a href='https://support.plex.tv/articles/navigating-the-mobile-apps/'>this page</a> may help you.

      <h2>Something missing from my libary? Add it!</h2>
      <p>
        åŒ—è¦‹å¸‚Â² (kitami two) uses Ombi to manage user requests for content. Before, I had to manually approve each request or deny it if it broke any rules. Now that the rules are out the window, I've enabled automatic request approval so the only delay will be in the time it takes to download it to the sever (typically seconds)!<br>
        I've not tested this feature very extensively so please give it a go and see if it works. You can access Ombi <a href='https://ombi.kitami.cloud/search'>here</a>.
